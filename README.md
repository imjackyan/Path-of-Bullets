# Path-of-Bullets
A shoot em up game made with HTML/CSS/JS

This game features many flexibilities that other bullet hell games don't offer!
- Flexible shooting patterns, weapon types, attribute optimizations (damage, fire rate, etc.)
- Skills and stats unique to each hero/ship

I have created this game as a hobby, influenced and inspired by the incredible flexibility offered by Path of Exile~
